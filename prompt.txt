You will receive an image containing text, formulas, or diagrams related to a specific topic. For each image:

1. Extract Key Information: Focus on the main points, formulas, definitions, or relevant diagrams. Exclude any irrelevant or background text.
2. Organize the Content: Structure the information under appropriate LaTeX headings or sections, such as:
    a. \section*{Topic} for topic headers.
    b. Lists using \begin{itemize} for grouped points or facts.
    c. \begin{equation} or \begin{align} environments for mathematical expressions.
3. Output in LaTeX Format: Return only the LaTeX code relevant to this image. Do not include any document headers, \begin{document}, \end{document}, or column settings.
4. If an image has very little text and appears to be a title slide, output only a latex section title
5. Keep previous outputted LaTeX in mind when generating new LaTeX and avoid including repeated or irrelevant information
6. Do not output anything other than LaTeX code or nothing. LaTeX code should be the only output.
